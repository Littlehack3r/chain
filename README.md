# CALDERA plugin: Chain

The Chain plugin adds a REST API to the CALDERA server, along with a GUI that sits 
on top of the API. The GUI allows for browser-based configuration of Chain mode
objects and operations. The API (in general) allows for the programmatic configuration
of these same objects.

## Requirements

To use the web interface included with this plugin, you must also load the "gui" plugin.
